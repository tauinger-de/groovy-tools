# groovy-tools

A (opefully growing) collection of groovy scripts to perform tasks I encounter every now and then.

## PrintWeeks

Prints a list of week titles to the console, which can be used e.g. by pasting those into a 
spreadsheet when wanting to perform week based calculations. 
The goal is to have both week numbers and an intuitive from/to info at hand to understand best
what week is meant.
